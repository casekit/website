            <p>We want our software to work in a holistic way to support the whole of an organisation. We will be adding more and more tools to help do this: powerful analytics, report generation, appointment reminders, referral letter templates, and more.</p>

            <p>We are creating a way for organisations to connect and share resources with each other in a durable and scalable way: a library of resources where organisations can store the resources they use, discover new ones, and share their own services with other organisations.</p>

            <h3>Empowering users</h3>
            <p>We believe that people are more engaged in systems they have access to, and more likely to attend appointments or use services they have a saved record of. We plan to give organisations the ability to let people easily, remotely (and, of course, securely) access their own cases.</p>
