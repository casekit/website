			<h2>Hello there, we are Case Kit</h2>
			<p>We are a social enterprise building a case management system for community support and other third sector organisations. This will be a system where records can be stored, accessed and edited alongside analytics and tools which provide further support to these organisations</p>
			<p>We are currently designing, developing, and testing and hope to be launching in Summer 2020. <a href="mailto:hello@casekit.co.uk" target="_blank">Get in touch to find out more or to register your interest</a>

				<h3>Powerful supporting tools</h3>
				<p>We want our software to work in a holistic way to support the whole of an organisation. We will be adding more and more tools to help do this: powerful analytics, report generation, appointment reminders, referral letter templates, the auto-generation of GDPR reports, and more.</p>

				<h3>A shared resource library</h3>
				<p>We are creating a way for organisations to connect and share resources with each other in a durable and scalable way: a library of resources where organisations can store the resources they use, discover new ones, and share their own services with other organisations.</p>

				<h3>Empowering users</h3>
				<p>We believe that people are more engaged in systems they have access to, and more likely to attend appointments or use services they have a saved record of. We plan to give organisations the ability to let people easily, remotely (and, of course, securely) access their own cases.</p>
